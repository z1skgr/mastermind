# Mastermind
 Mastermind Game

Its beginner's project for start learning C language.

# Description of the project
In this exercise, it is the implementation of a simple game, variant of the well-known Mastermind. In its version
game to be implemented, the player will play against the computer and try to guess the n digits of a secret number in the decimal numbering system. The number of digits of the number will be given at the start of the game and can be from 3 to a top 5. Also, at the start of the game will be determined if repeating digits are allowed in the secret number.

The player gives successive numbers n digits trying to guess the secret number (he can also give up giving a negative number). The program calculates and prints each time a message with information about the number of digits that the player manages to guess and how many of them are in their correct position. Once the player correctly guesses all the digits of the number in their correct positions, the program prints a related message as well as the number of attempts made by the player.
